I'm an immigrant  who came here in States to fulfill American dreams and live far away from where I grew up in Bangladesh, and worked the entire life in retail industry in New York City. I’m used to change and hustle, not afraid of any challenges that comes on my way and certainly know how to adapt to any circumstances in any situatuon.


Life is too short to give up......
After 5 years of working as a manager for a huge retail company in New York City, I realized I wasn't doing enough with my life but making money and that is not what I should do with my life. At work I loved the people I worked with everyday and solving my customers issue and making them happy was the best thing that I used to enjoy and used to get lots of compliments and thank you letters from them but at the same time I was feeling something is missing in my life.

I enrolled myself into  a communtity college, I went there for a year but at the same time I was trying to figure out what I really want and what I am good at. However, I also wanted to find out what I am really passionate about and want to make it my goal. It took me a year just getting a degree isn't what I am looing for and that is not the only thing I want to do with my life.

I always liked computers and when I young and in 4th grade, I learned how to play tunes using DOS command. Since then I was into computers but I couldn't go further with it because my parents couldn't afford bying a computer for me. 

So, I started looking for programs and then I came across with this website Udemy where I found thousands of people self learning programming and languages to build their own programs.

I learned how to build little programs, how to write code and build small andriod apps and after that, I became more and more curious about it, about different programming languages, all the things you can build, I was hooked.

The more I researched about it the more I fell in love with it, the kind of people you can work with and things you can do and create new things just amaze me, the absolute real need for more web developers, beng a developer is the most collest thing and fun thing I have came across so far in my life. You don’t have to be a genius, nor you need a computer science degree, just passion, imagination, willing to learn and sitting on my desk and with a coffee every morning and work on my stuff is the best thing I can ever have and when I see I build something like an app or a cool website, there's nothing I can enjoy more than being a coder and a builder where I can work and feel my passion and fulfill my dream.
